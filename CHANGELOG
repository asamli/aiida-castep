0.2.0
=====

Policy of setting calculation state has now changed.
A `FINISHED` state will be set given the excution was terminated safetly and without error,
even if the underlying *task* is not finished.
For example, a geometry optimisation will be set to `FINISHED` even if it did not reached
convergence, given that it was exited cleanly by reaching `geom_max_iter` or time limit (but not the `stop` key in param file).  
The primiary drive of this is to allow unconverged but cleanly finished calculations to be used as cached calculation.
